- What is nested list?
A list that is included in another list. For exp:
>>> a= [1, 2, 3, 4,[20, 10]]
>>> print(a[4])
{20, 10]
- Can a list store both intergers and strings in it?
Yes, it can.

-Exercise1:
>>> list(range(10,0,-2))
[10,8,6,4,2]

>>> list(range(0,10,-2))
[]
the list command will result in an empty list

the relationship among "start, stop, step":
    start: the start point. the number that is listed as the start point will equal to point in the list.
    stop: the end point, the number that is listed as the end point will larger or smaller than the point in the list (one step less).
    step: the amount of number that the list will change gradually, increase or decrease depends on the start and stop ponts.
for exp:
>>> list(range(15,5,-3))
[15,12,9,6]
>>> list(range(5,100,25))
[5,30,55,80]


-Exercise2:
There will be only one turtle because "alex" is not another turtle but a variable for tess.Turtle. 
so it will have one turtle and if we change the color of the variable(alex) then we will change the color of the turtle
